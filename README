Quickly populate your site with dummy content.

== Description ==
Being a website developer myself I hate wasting time adding filler content just to see how a new theme could look. I created this plugin to quickly do that task for me.

Overview
The plugin will populate your site with dummy, titles, contents, and even featured images.

It can create posts, pages, or custom post types. It can also create terms for any registered taxonomies you might have.

There are a few different options to play around with.

Please feel free to comment on any bugs or ideas for improvement.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and Upload all files in `scf-dummy.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go the the Options page to customize the dummy content

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I upload my own images =

Yes you can. In the options page there is an image uploader just for that.

== Screenshots ==

1. Fresh WordPress install before SCF Dummy Content plugin is executed.
2. Fresh WordPress install after SCF Dummy Content plugin is executed.
